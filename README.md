# MyWeatherApp

Welcome to my Weather App.

You can find the current weather of any city and save multiple cities in the search history. You will also find the 5 day forecast of the city you search. You will get information such as Wind speed, UV Index, temperature, whether it will be cloudy or sunny etc. 

Due to time constraints, when you refresh the page, unfortunately when you refresh the page, all the data from the search history disappears (it is saved in JSON).
